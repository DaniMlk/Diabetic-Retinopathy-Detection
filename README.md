# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
in this file we solve the Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection competition and get the accuracy of 85% for our test dataset.
we implement this code in pytorch. we do some pre-processing thing to get better accuracy with opencv. 
requirement for the run this code:</br>
Pytorch</br>
tensorboard
