# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
In this implementation, I solved the Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection competition and get the accuracy of 85% for our test dataset.
I implement this code in pytorch platform. To get a better result, I did some pre-processing image that shows as pre_kaggle.py file
the requirement for the run these codes are Tensorflow and Pytorch platform and for image processing I used opencv:</br>
Pytorch</br>
tensorboard
